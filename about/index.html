            <h2>NAME</h2>
            <p><b>Errormine</b> (stylized as <b>errormine</b>) comes from the words <i>error</i> + <i>ermine</i>. I don't know how to pronounce it either. I realize now some people might think it means <i>"a mine of errors"</i> which is fun, but that was not my intention. It is too late now.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/acJ3hiRxWUk">WHY?</a></h2>
            <p>Similar to many others, I have gotten tired of social media as well as the detrimental effect it was having on my mental health and well being. As well as the countless hours I was giving up every day to make some corporation just a little bit richer.</p>
            <figure class="medium-large">
                <blockquote cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26721576">It's surprising how many people equate "the Internet" with "social media". It's like having access to 1,000,000x the Library of Alexandria every day, and only being interested in keeping up with what people are talking about in the lobby.</blockquote>

            <p>Some time in 2021, I discovered Neocities, and I immediately realized what I had been missing. Inspired by all the incredible pages I found on this site, I've created my very own page, and here it stands now for your enjoyment.</p>
            <p>I'm not completely sure what I would like to put here yet, but we will see what seems interesting and go with it! I hope it becomes a place where I can express myself without having to worry about any sort of interaction with algorithms or advertisement from companies.</p>

            <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
            <p>Now, I'm no graphic designer nor do I claim to know what I'm doing at all when it comes to web design. However, I do enjoy making cute little websites and I would like to share some of my inspirations for this one.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The look of this site was heavily inspired by the wonderful video game <i><a href="https://obradinn.com/">Return of the Obra Dinn</a></i>, as well as many retro monochrome displays from a time long before my conception.</p>
            <p>Right now there is only one color scheme available, but I have thought about adding more like the ones that are in Return of the Obra Dinn. If I ever do, I will update this page and link to where you can select your desired color scheme.</p>

            <p>Some of the stoats you can find around these pages are from another video game called <i><a href="https://www.inscryption.com/">Inscryption</a></i>. One of the main characters happens to be a stoat, just like in this website! I was also heavily inspired by the abundant use of wildlife and fauna motifs in the game so you will definitely see a lot of wild animals around the place.</p>
