I originally created this Neocities page in November of 2021, and filled it with some rather boring stuff. I tried to get a few of my friends to also make their own pages in the hopes that their work would inspire me to find more things to put on my page. Unfortunately, that never happened and then this page just sat here for a few months.

Recently, however, I've found the motivation to redo my page once again, and hopefully I will be able to fill it with better things! Things that you can look at and click on and maybe find quirky or interesting.

Please explore a little, and let me know if the website is crap. I will do my best to keep updating it with interesting things whenever I can.
