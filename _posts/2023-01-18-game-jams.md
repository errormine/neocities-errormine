Turns out I'm terrible at keeping up with a blog. Who would've guessed.

Anyway! If you're a game developer or just wanna check out some quirky indie games, please visit [Experimental Game Jams](https://experimentaljams.com/). A monthly game jam focused on finding new and interesting gameplay mechanics as well as having fun!!! It's created by the wonderful [Scarbyte](https://scarbyte.com/). Myself and a few others will be participating, hopefully creating some fun little games and learning along the way. I hope you'll check it out.
