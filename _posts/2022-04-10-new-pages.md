I've restructured my <a href="/links/">links</a> page to be more consistent with my other pages. Having colorful images on there was bugging me quite a bit so it's been simplified. You can check out the <a href="/discord/">discord</a> page to join some of the Discord servers that I'm in.

I've also been working on a page that would allow me to share some albums that I like, and I wanted the page to be able to play songs as well. A friend of mine showed me <a href="https://webamp.org/">Webamp</a> which is a JavaScript version of Winamp that works entirely in your brower. I think it's super cool, and using Webamp I'm able to make the page super interactive! It should be up and running at <a href="/jukebox/">/jukebox/</a> so go visit and check out some of the music on there.

EDIT: I've removed the jukebox page to simplify my website's layout
