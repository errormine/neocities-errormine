## THIS WEBSITE

This website was originally created in 2021 for me to have some fun practicing web development. It has grown a bit since then, and been through many changes. The previous iteration became tiresome to maintain so I've started it again from the ground up. I'm sure the same thing will happen again, eventually.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/errormine/neocities-errormine) under the public domain. Any other content such as images, written word, or otherwise are NOT free to use unless explicitly marked as such. I do not own all of the content on this website, and any pages which contain copyrighted materials will be clearly labeled.

## TOOLS

I am using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate static pages from markdown content. It requires Node.js so it's not the most elegant solution, but it's simple enough that I can easily maintain the website, and powerful enough to do more than I probably need.

## CONTACT

If you would like to contact me, please shout very loudly and hopefully I will be able to hear you. Alternatively, you may send a message on my Neocities <a href="https://neocities.org/site/errormine">profile page</a>. Thank you.
