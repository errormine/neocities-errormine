                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hello, this is a small website I created after discovering Neocities. Eventually it will contain random stuff that I find interesting. I currently run another website that is way messier than this one and that contains more stuff about me personally.</p>
                <p>I'm not completely sure what I would like to put here yet, but we will see what seems interesting and go with it! I might end up just using it to share cool things created by other people.</p>
                <p>This page is being hosted on Neocities since it's completely free and has an interesting way for me to find other people's websites.</p>

                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>Now, I'm no graphic designer nor do I claim to know what I'm doing at all when it comes to web or graphic design. However, I do enjoy making cute little websites and I would like to share some of my inspirations for this one.</p>
                <div>
                    <figure class="float-left">
                        <img src="img/obra_dinn.png" alt="Return of the Obra Dinn Logo">
                    </figure>
                    <p>The look of this site was heavily inspired by the wonderful <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/">Return of the Obra Dinn</a></em>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/dukope">Lucas Pope</a>, which I have been fascinated with the look of since playing it a while ago. </p>
                    <p>Most images are dithered thanks to an article I read about <em><a href="https://endtimes.dev/why-you-should-dither-images/">Why Your Website Should Use Dithered Images</a></em>, and it just so happens to match the 1-bit aesthetic of the game as well.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Obra Dinn has many retro inspired monochrome color schemes but I stole this one because it's very comfortable on my eyes. This color scheme is titled "IBM 8503" in the settings, and the hex codes are #2e3037 and #ebe5ce. </p>
                <p>On my <a href="links.html">links</a> page you can also find a bunch of websites that have inspired me to create my own. Some are from Neocities and some are ones that I found elsewhere. Either way they should all be great and worth a visit!</p>

                <h2>Tools</h2>
                <p>Everything is hand written using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and hosted on this great website called <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>! Any images I use are either by me or found on the internet, original authors will always be linked. Any dithered images are created using this tool called <a href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/">Dither Me This</a>.</p>

                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>For now, if you would like to contact me, please shout very loudly and hopefully I will be able to hear you. Some time in the future I will set up an email or some other way. Thank you.</p>
