description: I have updated some of the stuff on my about and links pages.

I have updated some of the stuff on my <a href="/about/">about</a> and <a href="/links/">links</a> pages. Ctrl + F5 to make sure you don't have an old version still cached. There is now a lot more info about this website, a button wall, and a few more Discord servers you can check out.

I'm also currently working on a page that will be an interactive showcase of some of the music that I enjoy and would like to share with others. Hoping to get that finished soon! In the mean time, you can visit my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/prycaustic">last.fm</a> and see some the music I've been listening to.

Midterm exams are almost over as well so I should be able to work on this website even more in a couple weeks. I've got some cool ideas that I would love to share with everyone.

Also, I figured out a decent system for organizing multiple pages with different styles so I will try to experiment with different looks and create a bunch of wild looking pages. The main ones will remain simple and maintain a consistent accessible style, but other more "fun" ones may not be as restrained.

That's all for today, stay well.
